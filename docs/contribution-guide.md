# Contribution guide

This document covers the conventions and paradigms used in this codebase. We generally try to keep things simple in hopes that it will be easy to dive in and contribute.

## Components

We rely heavily on Material UI. When a component exists in Material UI, use it instead of creating one by hand. 

## Styles 

- Currently we use inline styles. The plan is to continue doing so until performance issues arise. 
- We use a 4px grid system. All padding, margins, and widths should be divisible by 4.
- When using the main theme colors (white, black, or purple), please use Material UI's useTheme hook.

## Global state 

There are a few things stored in context, but mostly pages fetch their own data.

## Translations 

All displayed text must support translation - for this we use `react-intl`. Translation keys are verbatum English abbreviations of the displayed text in all caps. You can see some examples in `/locale/en.json`. 

If you want to help translate the project, that is very much appreciated and needed, but please don't do it by manually editing files in `/locale`. Your changes will wind up getting overwritten by Lokalise.

## Conventions 

- Any file with a React component should have the suffix `.jsx`
- Data fetching goes in `/src/models`
- Code specific to a certain page goes in `/src/pages`
- Components that are reused widely go in `/src/components`
- Post any questions in Github issues or send an email to ben@wildme.org 
- Thanks for contributing =)

## Making a hotfix

Likely you wont need to make a hotfix unless you are a Wild Me employee, but if the need arises please follow the [hotfix procedures](https://github.com/WildMeOrg/codex-frontend/blob/develop/docs/hotfix-procedure.md).
